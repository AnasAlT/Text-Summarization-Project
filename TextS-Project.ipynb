    "They are based on the neural structure of the brain. The brain basically learns from experience. It is natural proof that some problems that are beyond the scope of current computers are indeed solvable by small energy efficient packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Human Neurons:\n",
    "To understand how artificial neural networks work let’s first briefly look at the human ones. The exact workings of the human brain are still a mystery. Yet, some aspects of this amazing processor are known. In particular, the most basic element of the human brain is a specific type of cell which, unlike the rest of the body, doesn’t appear to regenerate. Because this type of cell is the only part of the body that isn’t slowly replaced, it is assumed that these cells are what provides us with our abilities to remember, think, and apply previous experiences to our every action. These cells, all 100 billion of them, are known as neurons. Each of these neurons can connect with up to 200,000 other neurons, although 1,000 to 10,000 is typical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are typically organized in layers. Layers are made up of a number of interconnected ‘nodes’ which contain an ‘activation function’. Patterns are presented to the network via the ‘input layer’, which communicates to one or more ‘hidden layers’ where the actual processing is done via a system of weighted ‘connections’. \n",
    "In the same way that we learn from experience in our lives as mentioned above, neural networks require data to learn. In most cases, the more data that can be thrown at a neural network, the more accurate it will become. Think of it like any task you do over and over. Over time, you gradually get more efficient and make fewer mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When researchers or computer scientists set out to train a neural network, they typically divide their data into three sets. First is a training set, which helps the network establish the various weights between its nodes. After this, they fine-tune it using a validation data set. Finally, they’ll use a test set to see if it can successfully turn the input into the desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the training and supervisory stage, the ANN is taught what to look for and what its output should be, using Yes/No question types with binary numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest variant is the feed-forward neural network. This type of artificial neural network algorithm passes information straight through from input to processing nodes to outputs. It may or may not have hidden node layers, making their functioning more interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "More complex are recurrent neural networks. These deep learning algorithms save the output of processing nodes and feed the result back into the model. This is how the model is said to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks are popular today, particularly in the realm of image recognition. This specific type of neural network algorithm has been used in many of the most advanced applications of AI including facial recognition, text digitization and natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several strategies for learning, such as:\n",
    "Supervised Learning\n",
    "Essentially, a strategy that involves a teacher that is smarter than the network itself. For example, let’s take the facial recognition example. The teacher shows the network a bunch of faces, and the teacher already knows the name associated with each face. The network makes its guesses, then the teacher provides the network with the answers. The network can then compare its answers to the known “correct” ones and make adjustments according to its errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "Required when there isn’t an example data set with known answers. Imagine searching for a hidden pattern in a data set. An application of this is clustering, i.e. dividing a set of elements into groups according to some unknown pattern. We won’t be looking at any examples of unsupervised learning in this chapter, as this strategy is less relevant for our examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "A strategy built on observation. Think of a little mouse running through a maze. If it turns left, it gets a piece of cheese; if it turns right, it receives a little shock. (Don’t worry, this is just a pretend mouse.) Presumably, the mouse will learn over time to turn left. Its neural network makes a decision with an outcome (turn left or right) and observes its environment (yum or ouch). If the observation is negative, the network can adjust its weights in order to make a different decision the next time. Reinforcement learning is common in robotics. At time t, the robot performs a task and observes the results. Did it crash into a wall or fall off a table? Or is it unharmed? We’ll look at reinforcement learning in the context of our simulated steering vehicles.) ...\n",
